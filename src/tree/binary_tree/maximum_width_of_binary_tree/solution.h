Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum width of the given tree.

The maximum width of a tree is the maximum width among all levels.

The width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the
leftmost and rightmost non-null nodes), where the null nodes between the
end-nodes are also counted into the length calculation.

It is guaranteed that the answer will in the range of 32-bit signed integer.
